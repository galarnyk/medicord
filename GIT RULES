To get the repository for the first time (clone it from the web to local...)
	
	git clone git@github.com:galarnyk/cs408.git

To check status of your LOCAL repository:
	
	git status

ALWAYS PULL before you COMMIT or PUSH

If your git status shows an "untracked" file:
	
	git add file

Then git status will show "new file" which means it was added

To pull the latest project from GITHUB:
	
	git pull

To commit your changes (such as after an add, and after checking that you have the latest version with git pull):
	
	git commit

THEN PUSH YOUR CHANGE TO GITHUB:
	
	git push
